#  Project Setup

1. Make sure you have a valid Apple developer account.
2. If you're using this sample project, create your own CloudKit container identifier (under Targets -> My Quotes -> Signing & Capabilities -> CloudKit -> Container)
3. Have ideally two iPhones or iPads.

CloudKit syncing uses silent push notifications in the background, which the simulator can't do. Thus, the requirement of real devices.
